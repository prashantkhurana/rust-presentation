 # Presentation of a few concepts of rust lang https://prashantkhurana.github.io/rust-presentation/

 Topics covered :
 
*  Introduction to rust 
	*  Ownership
*  Reference & Borrowing 
*  Lifetimes overview

 The idea of the presentation is to introduce to the above concepts. The talk is more about the concepts and less about rust, hence code snippets might not be using the best practices of rust, for keeping things simple.
